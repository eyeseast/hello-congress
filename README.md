Hello, Congress!
===============

This is a basic demo app to see what I could build in a short time with [Flask][F] and the [New York Times Congress API][T].

Installation:

    pip install -e git+git://github.com/eyeseast/hello-congress.git

Or download/clone and

    python setup.py install

This is just for fun.
